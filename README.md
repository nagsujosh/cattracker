# Lost and Found Service App

## **Overview**
The Lost and Found Service App is a user-friendly platform that helps university students find and report lost items on campus. Users can create, update, and delete tickets for lost and found items, search for items using detailed descriptions, and upload photos for better identification. With features like real-time chat and advanced semantic search, the app simplifies the process of reconnecting students with their belongings.

## **Key Features**

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and manage user profiles securely.
- **Ticket Management**: Easily create, update, and delete tickets for lost and found items.
- **Real-time Chat**: Communicate with other users in real time using Flask-SocketIO. *(Feature in development)*
- **Photo Upload**: Upload and store item images in Azure Blob Storage for better item identification.
- **Semantic Search**: Use AI-powered semantic search from `sentence-transformers` to locate items quickly based on descriptive queries.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a smooth experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Flask (web framework) with Flask-SocketIO for real-time communication.
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage for securely storing images.
- **AI/ML**: Pre-trained models from `sentence-transformers` for semantic search.
- **Containerization**: Docker for environment consistency across development and production.

## **Azure Services Used**
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Stores uploaded photos of lost and found items.
- **Azure Functions**: Handles backend processes like user authentication and service logic.
